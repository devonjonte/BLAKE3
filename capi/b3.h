/* libb3_servil: the C API of blake3-servil.
 *
 * The C API is the library's convenience API: one message hashed at once,
 * or fed in pieces, on the calling thread, with every feature of BLAKE3
 * (the plain hash, the keyed hash, key derivation, extended output). The
 * batch, multi-core and stream calls are the Rust crate's throughput API.
 * Hashing entry points initialize the library automatically. Initialization
 * runs a startup self-test, which stops the program if this build or CPU
 * computes wrong digests. Later initialization calls check the completed
 * state.
 *
 * Memory: pointers cover live, correctly aligned storage of the stated
 * sizes, readable for inputs and writable for outputs. Output storage may
 * hold anything, uninitialized too: every call writes all of it. Read-only ranges
 * may overlap; a written range is disjoint from every other range a call
 * uses. Inputs stay unchanged, and outputs are not accessed concurrently
 * by the caller. Simple guards reject misaligned handles, unrepresentable
 * sized ranges, and immediate hasher data overlaps before borrowing
 * them. Detected invalid arguments stop the program with a message.
 * These checks do not establish allocation ownership or lifetime. The
 * remaining memory rules are caller obligations; violations may be
 * undefined behavior.
 *
 * Threads: any call may be made from any thread, and every call runs on
 * the calling thread alone. A b3_mode is a value and may be shared and
 * read by any number of threads at once. Calls using the same b3_hasher
 * are serialized by the caller.
 *
 * Link with -lb3_servil (libb3_servil.a, or libb3_servil.so /
 * libb3_servil.dylib). Build and install with `cargo cinstall --release`
 * in capi/; `pkg-config --cflags --libs b3_servil` gives the compiler flags.
 * The shared library has a versioned soname. C11, or C++11.
 * B3_VERSION names the header's version; b3_version() the library build's,
 * which starts with it (and adds, past a release's own commit, the commit
 * built and a dirty tree's Git tree id), so a program can check that the
 * two agree.
