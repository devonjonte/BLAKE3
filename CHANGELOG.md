# Unreleased: changes since 0.8 (a draft for 0.9)

The figures for this release come from its release runs; this section
lists what changed, each item with where it is described.

## Two crates, and no streaming API in this release

- **`blake3-servil-core`** is BLAKE3-Servil on one thread: every call
  hashes on the thread that makes it, and the crate starts no thread. Its
  assembly kernels are each proved against the BLAKE3 specification.
  Without its `std` feature it needs no allocator.
- **`blake3-servil`** is that crate, whole, with a pool of threads and a
  multithreaded form of each call: `hash_multithreaded`,
  `hash_many_multithreaded`, `hash_each_multithreaded`,
  `update_multithreaded`, `update_each_multithreaded`.
- **0.9 has no streaming API.** 0.8's stream (`performance::stream`) is
  gone, and one streaming API, the Pipeline, is being built to replace it
  after 0.9 (#356). A program that feeds 0.8's stream waits for the
  Pipeline's release and stays on 0.8 until then, knowing the stream's
  two faults there (below, "Safer"). Where a program can do without a
  stream, 0.9's calls take whole inputs: `hash_multithreaded` (one
  message), `hash_many_multithreaded` (a batch), `hash_each_multithreaded`
  (messages of different lengths), `update_multithreaded` (one message
  fed in pieces). Used in a stream's place they are slower ("Slower",
  below).

## What a program on 0.8 changes

- **`performance` is `throughput`**: the module's name; its calls keep
  theirs.
- **The `Hasher` is `convenience::Hasher`** (it was `performance::Hasher`):
  - `Hasher::new(mode)` is `Hasher::new(mode, length_hint)`, the hint an
    `Option<u64>`; `None` is always right;
  - `finalize` and `finalize_xof` take the hasher (`self`, where they
    took `&self`);
  - `count` and `reset` are gone;
  - the method `hasher.update_multithreaded(input)` is the call
    `throughput::update_multithreaded(&mut hasher, input)`.
- **`finalize_each` takes `&mut [Hasher]`** (it took `&[Hasher]`): each
  hasher it finishes starts again.
- **The stream is gone**: `performance::stream`, `Stream` and its seven
  methods.

Unchanged for a caller, though the signature reads differently:
`hash_many` and `hash_many_multithreaded` take any `Prepared` input, and
`&Batch` is one. New: `Packed<16>` and `Packed<32>` (the other `Prepared`
input) and the constant `BUILD_VERSION`. `Hash`, `Mode`, `Block`,
`OutputReader`, the three `convenience` calls, `context_key` and the
other `throughput` calls read the same in both. A program that depends
on `blake3-servil` keeps the crate's name: it re-exports everything the
core documents and adds the multithreaded calls and
`initialize_multithreaded`.

## The API: one call family for a hash now and then, one for call after call

- **`convenience`** is for a hash amid other work: `hash`, `hash_with`,
  `hash_xof`, and now the incremental `Hasher`. Its paths are tuned for
  code that has left the caches (on AArch64, its kernels' code is
  prefetched). The length hint is a scheduling hint and never part of the
  hash.
- **`throughput`** (the `performance` module of 0.8, renamed) is for call
  after call: `hash`, `hash_many`, `hash_each` and their multithreaded
  forms over prepared inputs (`Block`, `Batch`, `Packed`), and grouped
  incremental updates (`update_each`, `finalize_each`). A program chooses
  the pattern by the call it makes; no clock guesses it.
- **The C API is the convenience API**: `b3_hash`, `b3_hasher_*` (with
  the length hint) and the modes.
- **A build names its code** (#328): `BUILD_VERSION`, `b3_version()` and
  `b3sum --version`. A release reads its version; the code after one reads
  `X.Y.Z+dev` with its commit, and a dirty tree adds its Git tree id.

## Slower

**Without a stream: messages hashed one after another on many threads.**
This is what a program would see if it used 0.9's calls where it used
0.8's stream; a program that needs a stream waits for the Pipeline.
0.8's stream hashed on the workers while the program read the next
message, gathered short messages into lanes and spread them over the
cores. A call a message does none of that. On a Ryzen 9700X (16 threads)
a program that hashes messages one after another through
`hash_multithreaded` takes, against 0.8's stream: 2.7 to 3 times the time
for messages of 16 KiB to 64 MiB, and 3.6 to 24 times for messages of
64 B to 4 KiB, the most at 512 B and 1 KiB. Gathering short messages into
batches for `hash_many_multithreaded` recovers most of it: batches one
after another take 1.2 to 2.9 times the stream's time. The
single-threaded calls are unaffected. (A check of the two-crate tree
against 0.8, four pairs a cell; the release runs give the release's
figures.)

**On purpose, on AArch64: a `throughput` call made now and then.** 0.8
guessed with a clock whether a call came after a pause, and prefetched
its kernels' code when it did. 0.9 has no such clock (#253): the call
decides. So on AArch64 a `throughput` call made amid other work, where
0.8's clock would have prefetched, is slower than 0.8:

- `hash_multithreaded` of one message of 1.5 to 16 KiB;
- `hash_many` over a batch of 2 to 8 short messages, on one thread or many.

The remedy for one message is the call made for that pattern,
`convenience::hash`, which prefetches on every call of 1 to 64 KiB. A
small batch amid other work has no such call yet. Call after call, both
are as fast as before or faster. The release runs give the figures; an
Apple M6's are in #364.

**Cause not yet known: single-threaded `hash_many` over a batch of 2 or 4
messages, after a brief pause (20 μs).** 4.4% and 3.2% more time on two
EPYC 7443; level on an i7-12700K. The two sides were measured under two
versions of the benchmark, so the library's part in it is not yet
separated (#369).

## Faster

- **On x86-64, whole chunks and parents round up to the lanes** (#248,
  #345): 3 inputs run on 4 lanes, 5 to 7 on 8, 9 to 15 on 16 and 17 to 31
  on 32 where those kernels run, each in one pass where the kernels took
  two or three; the spare lanes hash a copy whose result is dropped. One
  message of 3 KiB to 7935 B takes 24 to 45% less time on a Ryzen 9700X.
- **On x86-64, packed leaves and a batch's messages of 1 to 63 bytes
  run eight at a time on AVX2 and sixteen on AVX-512** (#297), on the
  kernels `finalize_each` uses: a single-threaded Merkle tree over 16- or
  32-byte leaves takes 74 to 78% less time on a Ryzen 9700X and an EPYC
  9275F (sixteen lanes), and 45 to 57% less on two EPYC 7443 (eight). One
  cell pays, on that last machine alone: its multithreaded tree of
  1,048,576 leaves of 32 B, on 96 threads, takes 6% more (#372).
- **`Packed<16>` and `Packed<32>`**: a batch of 16- or 32-byte messages
  (Merkle leaves, digests) hashed without the program writing each into a
  block of its own first (#289).
- **`finalize_each` finishes sixteen hashers at once on AVX-512**, each
  with its own chaining value and flags, on a proved kernel; its indices
  are distinct, a contract a debug build checks (#295).
- **On AArch64, many short messages fed in small pieces finish side by
  side** (#298): 1,024 open messages of 1 KiB arriving in 256-byte pieces
  take 68 to 71% less time a cycle on an M4 Max. Plain messages alone: a
  keyed hasher's key is secret, so it finishes by itself as before.
- **A Hasher's in-place checkpoint copies only the bytes it has staged**
  (`clone_from`), not its whole 16 KiB stage (#283).

## Steadier

- **After preparation, the pool's calls allocate nothing** (#325): a
  whole message, a batch, a collection of chunk-sized items, and repeated
  update-and-finish cycles of 4 MiB messages in every mode, on the calling
  thread and the workers, the first cycle included.
  `initialize_multithreaded` prepares the calling thread's scratch (48 KiB,
  for inputs to 64 MiB).
- **A repeated collection allocates nothing** (#325): `hash_each` keeps
  its messages' places and chunk values on the calling thread between
  calls, where each call took them and freed them.

## Safer

Where an entry says 0.8 has the fault, the remedy for a program on 0.8 is
this release: no 0.8.x follows.

- **0.8's stream has two faults, and 0.9 has no stream.** In 0.8 a worker
  claimed a task in the stream's ring and then copied it, and a worker
  delayed between the two could copy a later task written into the same
  slot (#302). And `performance::Stream::open` is public, safe and hidden
  from the docs: a safe program could open a stream, hand it borrowed
  input, forget it (`mem::forget`) and free the input while the workers
  still read it (#308). The remedy for a program on 0.8's stream is the
  Pipeline's release, which follows this one; 0.9's one-shot calls are a
  remedy today only where the program can do without a stream.
- **The C header says what a finished hasher takes** (#311): after
  `b3_hasher_finalize`, only `b3_hasher_new`. A finished hasher is not
  reset, and an update on it silently continued the old message. Official
  BLAKE3's hasher may be finalized again and updated further; code ported
  from it calls `b3_hasher_new` between messages.
- **`Batch::new` stops on a count whose blocks overflow** (#320). In 0.8,
  in a release build, a count of 128-byte messages past half of
  `usize::MAX` wrapped to zero blocks and returned an empty batch.
- **`update_each` groups held hashers by public facts alone**, the mode
  and the lengths, never by a key (#312). 0.8 grouped them by key.

## Checked more

- **Mutation testing on a budget**: a change's check covers its own lines
  in about a minute; the whole run, every mutant, gates each release.
- **Every speed-only mutant earns a test that counts its work**, with no
  clock, or its code goes; the pool's clock-bound knobs read a test clock.
- **The tests split in two**: the code's, on fixed inputs and the test
  clock, under two seconds; the machine's (clocks, counters, sleeps) by
  their own profile.

## To fill at the release

- The Faster table from each machine's release run.
- `Hash`'s hex in constant time (#370), when it lands.
- The x86-64 kernels that land before the release, each with its measured
  gain and its proof (Zen 5's integer-register chunk root).

# blake3-servil 0.8.0+b3c5efc7c975d903762dea809066f7c0a0603861, against official BLAKE3 1.8.7

The same digests. Faster than official BLAKE3 1.8.7 on 64-bit Arm and
x86-64. Every kernel is assembly, and every one is proved correct
within its stated contract. Everything else is tested, and the tests
are tested ([QUALITY.md](QUALITY.md)).

## Faster

Each figure is blake3-servil's speed over official BLAKE3 1.8.7's, both
measured in the same run by [bench-hashes](https://github.com/johnservil/bench-hashes)
0.18.1 at this release's commit (one run per machine, October 27).
On the every-core rows each uses its multithreaded function:

| | Intel i7-12700K | AMD EPYC 9255 | Apple M4 Max | Linux VM on the M4 Max |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| One message of 64 B | 0.8× | 1.1× | 1.5× | 1.1× |
| One message of 1 KiB | 1.1× | 1.1× | 1.2× | 1.2× |
| One message of 1 MiB, one thread | 1.0× | 1.2× | 2.5× | 2.5× |
| One message of 128 MiB, every core | 1.1× | 1.0× | 1.3× | 1.3× |
| A stream of 64 KiB messages, every core | 8.0× | 7.2× | 33× | 156× |
| A batch of 1024 messages, 64 B each | 1.1× | 1.1× | 1.9× | 1.8× |
| b3sum over 1000 files of mixed sizes | 3.4× | 5.8× | 4.6× | 26× |

On the M4 Max and in the VM, official's multithreaded call on each 64 KiB
message takes longer than its one-thread call (1.08 and 7.13 ns per byte,
against 0.42 and 0.43), so the stream row's figures there are large.

On 64-bit Arm, new kernels make every size faster: SME2 on the M4 and
later, and kernels that run the integer and NEON units side by side.
On x86-64 with SSE4.1 or AVX2, a single message hashes with official's
own assembly (each proved below), so it runs at official's speed (one
message of 64 B varies from run to run: 0.8× to 1.9× on the i7). On Linux on AMD Zen 5 and later,
new kernels hash 32 whole chunks or 16 parent nodes at once with AVX-512
(proved too): on the EPYC 9255, one thread hashing 32 KiB or more takes
about 20% less time than with upstream's 16-input AVX-512 kernel. Other
AVX-512 CPUs keep the 16-input kernel, which measured faster there (Zen 4:
the wide kernels 4-5% slower from memory; Intel Ice Lake: 3-4.5% slower
throughout). The other gains on x86-64 come
from many messages at once: a stream that hashes on other cores while
the program reads the next input, batches of short messages, and b3sum
over many files.

## Checked more

Beyond official's tests (published test vectors and a reference
implementation), this crate adds:

- **Formal proofs of every assembly kernel**, official's own x86-64
  assembly among them, at every shape this crate calls it: symbolic
  execution against a specification of BLAKE3, with memory accesses,
  the calling convention and secret-dependent branches checked too.
- **Mutation testing**: one small mistake planted at a time, more than
  2,000 in all, and a test must fail for each; every one that survives
  is listed with its reason.
- **A model checker (Shuttle)** for the thread pool's waits, under
  thousands of thread schedules.
- **Guard pages**: tests put an inaccessible page beside every input,
  output, key and context of every public call, in Rust and in C, so
  a call that touches one byte past the caller's memory crashes the
  test.
- **A startup self-test** of the build and the CPU before the first
  hash.

These found eight bugs before release, among them the AVX2 and AVX-512
batch kernels reading past an input's end at shapes this crate's batch
calls use (fixed here; see below). [QUALITY.md](QUALITY.md) says what
each check covers and what remains unproved.

## Before you switch

1. Targets: 64-bit Arm on Linux and macOS, x86-64 on Linux. Latest
   stable Rust and a C compiler, GCC 12 or Clang. Official BLAKE3 keeps
   Windows, 32-bit CPUs, big-endian CPUs, WebAssembly and older compilers;
   a build for any other target stops and names it.
2. Call `blake3_servil::initialize()` once before any other call. A
   program that makes multithreaded calls or uses a stream calls
   `initialize_multithreaded(None)` instead. A call before it panics.
3. Two kinds of call, in two modules. `convenience`: one call per hash,
   every feature, any slice, the result returned: `hash(input)` is now
   `convenience::hash(input)`, `keyed_hash(key, input)` is
   `convenience::hash_with(Mode::Keyed(key), input)`, `derive_key(context,
   material)` is `convenience::hash_with(Mode::DeriveKey(context),
   material)`, and `convenience::hash_xof(mode, input)` gives extended
   output. `performance`, for power users, has every way to hash fast.
   There the program takes on more of the work: inputs as `Block`s (64
   bytes on a 64-byte boundary: a message is blocks and a length, a
   batch messages of one length), digests into its places, and a `Mode`
   in every call. The `Hasher` is there too: `Hasher::new(mode)` replaces
   `Hasher::new()`, `Hasher::new_keyed` and `Hasher::new_derive_key`, the
   plain hash is `Mode::Plain`, and `Hasher` has no `Default`.
4. Threads are the crate's own. `Hasher::update_rayon` is now
   `update_multithreaded`. `performance::hash_multithreaded(mode, input)`
   hashes one message over the threads. There is no `rayon` feature.
5. Removed: `Hasher::update_mmap` and the `mmap` feature (map the file
   yourself, or use `update_reader`), the `traits-preview` feature, the
   `guts`, `hazmat`, and `platform` modules, and the `no_avx2`,
   `no_avx512`, `no_neon`, and `no_sme2` features, and `pure`: this crate
   runs its assembly or not at all. For portable Rust, or an x86-64 CPU
   without SSE4.1 (which stops at `initialize`), use official BLAKE3.
6. b3sum installs from the package `b3sums` (`cargo install b3sums`);
   crates.io's `b3sum` is official BLAKE3's. The program is still `b3sum`.
   `--num-threads N` means at most N threads in all, and 1 means one
   thread. `--no-mmap` does nothing. Every file is read to its end. A
   broken pipe ends b3sum quietly.

## New

- `performance::hash_many` and `hash_many_multithreaded`: a `Batch` of
  messages of one length, each in `Block`s (64 bytes on a 64-byte
  boundary). A `Batch` lets the program write only its messages' bytes,
  so the bytes past each message, which the batch kernels read in place,
  stay zero; a Merkle layer writes its digests straight into the next
  layer's `Batch`.
- `performance::hash_each` and `hash_each_multithreaded`: a collection of
  any lengths.
- `performance::update_each` and `finalize_each`: many messages in
  progress at once, each with its own `Hasher`.
- `performance::stream()`: inputs one after another, hashed behind the
  caller.
- A C API in `capi/b3.h`. The library is `libb3_servil`. C11 and C++11.
- `Mode::DeriveKeyWith` with `performance::context_key`: one context
  hashed once for many derivations.

## Different

- A startup self-test checks the build and the CPU. A wrong digest stops
  the process, uncatchably: with `std` it names the code path and aborts;
  without it, the CPU's trap instruction.
- A panic on one of the crate's threads, or in a caller during a
  multithreaded call, ends the process.
- The threads are the process's: in a child forked after they started,
  every multithreaded call and stream panics, saying so. A program that
  forks calls `initialize_multithreaded` in the process that hashes,
  after any fork; single-threaded calls work anywhere.
- A `Hasher` is about 18 KiB. It gathers short updates and hashes them
  side by side, so a message arriving in small pieces hashes as fast as
  one in a buffer.
- The AVX2 and AVX-512 batch kernels read nothing past an input's end.
- The crate leaves Arm's data-independent timing (DIT) as the calling
  thread has it. A program that wants Arm's promise turns DIT on in its
  own threads before it hashes (the quality manual, "Timing and secrets":
  [docs/quality-manual.md](docs/quality-manual.md)).
- Building the Arm kernels needs an assembler that knows armv8.2-a+sha3,
  GNU as 2.30 or LLVM 7; building the x86-64 kernels needs a C compiler
  that takes the AVX-512 flags, GCC 12 or Clang. Without one, the build
  stops and says so; official BLAKE3 builds without assembly. The SME2 kernels need Clang 17
  or GCC 14 with binutils 2.41; without those the build warns and leaves
  them out.
