# blake3-servil 0.8, against official BLAKE3 1.8.7

The same digests. Faster than official BLAKE3 1.8.7 on 64-bit Arm and
x86-64. Every Arm assembly kernel and the x86-64 assembly kernels are
proved correct within their stated contracts. Everything else is tested,
and the tests are tested ([QUALITY.md](QUALITY.md)).

## Before you switch

1. Targets: 64-bit Arm on Linux and macOS, x86-64 on Linux and Windows
   with MSVC. Latest stable Rust and a C compiler, GCC 12 or Clang.
   Official BLAKE3 keeps 32-bit CPUs, big-endian CPUs, WebAssembly, MinGW
   and older compilers.
2. Call `blake3_servil::initialize()` once before any other call. A
   program that makes multithreaded calls or uses a stream calls
   `initialize_multithreaded(None)` instead. A call before it panics.
3. Two kinds of call, in two modules. `convenience`: one call per hash,
   every feature, any slice, the result returned: `hash(input)` is now
   `convenience::hash(input)`, `keyed_hash(key, input)` is
   `convenience::hash_with(Mode::Keyed(key), input)`, `derive_key(context,
   material)` is `convenience::hash_with(Mode::DeriveKey(context),
   material)`, and `convenience::hash_xof(mode, input)` gives extended
   output. `performance`, for power users, has every way to hash fast,
   the `Hasher` among them (`Hasher::new_with(mode)` replaces
   `Hasher::new_keyed` and `Hasher::new_derive_key`): the program takes
   on more of the work, with inputs starting at 64-byte boundaries,
   digests into its places, and a `Mode` in every call.
4. Threads are the crate's own. `Hasher::update_rayon` is now
   `update_multithreaded`. `performance::hash_multithreaded(mode, input)`
   hashes one message over the threads. There is no `rayon` feature.
5. Removed: `Hasher::update_mmap` and the `mmap` feature (map the file
   yourself, or use `update_reader`), the `traits-preview` feature, the
   `guts`, `hazmat`, and `platform` modules, and the `no_avx2`,
   `no_avx512`, `no_neon`, and `no_sme2` features. `pure` stays.
6. b3sum installs from the package `b3sums` (`cargo install b3sums`);
   crates.io's `b3sum` is official BLAKE3's. The program is still `b3sum`.
   `--num-threads N` means at most N threads in all, and 1 means one
   thread. `--no-mmap` does nothing. Every file is read to its end. A
   broken pipe ends b3sum quietly.

## New

- `performance::hash_many` and `hash_many_multithreaded`: messages of
  one length in `Block`s (64 bytes on a 64-byte boundary), which a
  `Batch` builds with every byte past each message zero.
- `performance::hash_each` and `hash_each_multithreaded`: a collection of
  any lengths.
- `performance::update_each` and `finalize_each`: many messages in
  progress at once, each with its own `Hasher`.
- `performance::stream()`: inputs one after another, hashed behind the
  caller.
- A C API in `capi/b3.h`. The library is `libb3_servil`. C11 and C++11.
- `Mode::DeriveKeyMaterial` with `performance::hash_derive_key_context`: one context
  hashed once for many derivations.

## Different

- A startup self-test checks the build and the CPU. A wrong digest stops
  the process, uncatchably: with `std` it names the code path and aborts;
  without it, the CPU's trap instruction.
- A panic on one of the crate's threads, or in a caller during a
  multithreaded call, ends the process.
- A `Hasher` is about 18 KiB. It gathers short updates and hashes them
  side by side, so a message arriving in small pieces hashes as fast as
  one in a buffer.
- The AVX2 and AVX-512 batch kernels read nothing past an input's end.
- The crate leaves Arm's data-independent timing (DIT) as the calling
  thread has it. A program that wants Arm's promise turns DIT on in its
  own threads before it hashes (the quality manual, "Timing and secrets":
  [docs/quality-manual.md](docs/quality-manual.md)).
- Building the Arm kernels needs an assembler that knows armv8.2-a+sha3,
  GNU as 2.30 or LLVM 7. Without one, the build warns and leaves them out.
