//! The one way every measurement summarises and compares its samples, in
//! the fork, bench-hashes, and every probe.
//!
//! **A run's cost** for a cell is its mean: the total timed nanoseconds of
//! its samples over the total work they did ([`mean`]). That is what a
//! caller pays on average, it moves continuously when a cell spends more or
//! less of its time at a slower speed, and it takes no cut-offs.
//!
//! **Comparing two programs** takes pairs of runs, one of each, back to back
//! and in alternating order, so that drift between the runs falls on both
//! sides alike. Each pair gives one ratio per cell, new mean over old
//! ([`ratio_permille`]). Most of a measurement's uncertainty lies between
//! runs (where the program's code landed, where its threads were placed),
//! which no figure from inside one run can see; the pairs see it. A cell is
//! slower ([`verdict`]) when the median of its ratios exceeds 1 plus the
//! margin and an exact sign test says the new side was slower in more pairs
//! than chance would give, at one-sided p <= 5% ([`least_count`]): one
//! assumption alone, that a pair is as likely to come out either way when
//! nothing changed.
//!
//! **Values** are nanoseconds per unit in fixed point, 64 integer and 64
//! fractional bits (Q64.64, as bench-hashes' `Fixed`); ratios in permille;
//! integers throughout, rounded once where a person reads them.
