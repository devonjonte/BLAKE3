"""A short run of check.py, start to finish, for a change to it (CONTRIBUTING:
a tool that runs for hours lands after one on each kind of machine): two
shards on one small file; the next run's start-of-run cleanup, which keeps
the shards' worktrees and removes any other leftover; and a second run on
the kept worktrees, with the same outcome. About a minute and a half.

    python3 tools/mutants/smoke.py [--crate threads]

With --crate, the same on that crate (BLAKE3 #335): cargo runs in its
folder, in the shards' worktrees too, and the file is one of its own.
