"""Start, watch, and stop long jobs, by name, safely.

    python3 tools/jobs.py start NAME -- COMMAND...   run COMMAND as job NAME
    python3 tools/jobs.py status [NAME]              running or ended, and the log's tail
    python3 tools/jobs.py stop NAME|PID              stop it and every process it started
    python3 tools/jobs.py find TEXT                  the processes whose command line holds TEXT

A job runs in a session of its own (its own process group), with its
output in tmp/jobs/NAME.log and its process ID and start time in
tmp/jobs/NAME.pid, in the checkout this tool sits in; `start` refuses a
NAME still running. A process is the job's only while both match: a
record outlives a reboot, and its number may by then name another
process (one did, and `stop` would have ended it).
`stop` sends TERM to the job's process group and to every descendant of
its leader, waits up to 10 s, then sends KILL to what remains. It never
matches processes by name (as pkill -f does, which can match the shell
that runs it), and it refuses to stop itself or any process it descends
from. A raw PID stops that process's tree the same way. An ended
process whose parent is gone can linger as a zombie (ps state Z: the
VM's PID 1 reaps none); it holds nothing, and this tool counts it as
ended.

A record names its process by when it started, as `started` reads it.

`find` lists processes by their command line, for the PID to stop: it
never lists itself or a process it descends from, the shell that runs it
among them (pgrep -f lists that shell, whose command holds the pattern
too). The VM refuses pkill, pgrep and killall (vm/setup.sh), at Zooko's
request: matching by name has ended the shell running it many times.

Why and when to use it: AGENTS.md, "The VM" (BLAKE3-Servil's AGENTS.md).
